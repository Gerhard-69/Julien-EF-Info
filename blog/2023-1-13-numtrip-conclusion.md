# What was it all for?
The goal of this game was to introduce us students to the fundamentals of Python. We knew the game mechanics from the very beginning, we had total freedom on what approach we would take.

# The realisation of the game
### Requirements
+ Python 3.10 (2.0 is outdated and syntax is different)
+
